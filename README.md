#### Simon Milz, Marco Túlio Quintino

This is a repository for the article [Transformations between arbitrary quantum objects and the emergence of indefinite causality](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx)

 This code requires:
- [QETLAB](http://www.qetlab.com/) - a free MATLAB toolbox for quantum entanglement theory.

This repository contains of projectors onto the linear subspace spanned by Choi operators of:
- Quantum Channels
- Quantum Unital Channels
- Quantum SuperChannels
- Quantum Parallel Channels
- Quantum Parallel Processes
- Quantum Parallel SuperChannels
- Quantum Sequential Channels
- Quantum Sequential Processes
- Quantum Sequential SuperChannels
- Quantum Non-Signalling Channels
- Quantum General Processes (Process Matrices)
- Quantum General SuperChannels (Process with open Past and Future)

This repository also contains a function which implements the trace-and-replace map:
- TR
